# Overlay Camera

**Deprecated**: This mod is not straightforward to port to the newer official mod loader and new Besiege game versions, and a lack of time has prevented serious work on updating it so far. As such, it is only useful in old versions of Besiege currently, along with the old mod loader. If anybody feels like having a shot at making a version of this for the new mod loader, please feel free to do so! The license allows you to build on the existing code. If you do, I would love to hear about it!
